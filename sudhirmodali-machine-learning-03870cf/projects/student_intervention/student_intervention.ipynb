    "Gaussian Naive Bayes: Due to its simplicity, this algorithm could outperform more complex models when the data set isn’t large enough.Could be used when the actual probabilities for each class are not required, but only to determine which is the most likely.A classical use case for Naive Bayes is document classification: Determining whether a given (text) document corresponds to one or more categories. In the text case, the features used might be the presence or absence of key words.in the current problem of classifying the student intervention, this algorithm could help in providing the probabilities \"fastest\". Given Naive-Bayes' conditional independence assumption, when all the probabilities are multiplied you will get zero and this will affect the posterior probability estimate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machine: SVM is used quite extensively in image or text recognition and classification problems. given a bunch of labeled data, SVMs perform better when the number of samples maybe less than the features available. the major downside is that SVMs require a lot of tuning and maybe difficult to train unless there is a lot of awareness of the problem and/or data. Since the student data is labelled i.e \"passed\" and \"failed\" alongwith other features, the intuition is that the data can be linearly separable. hence using linear kernel or the RBF kernel would help in classifying the pass and fail categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "AdaboostClassifier: Boosting is an approach to machine learning based on the idea of creating a highly accurate prediction rule by combining many relatively weak and inaccurate rules.classifiers that come in next for execution are adjusted according to those instances that were wrongly classified with the previous classifiers.It is sensitive to noisy data and information that does not belong to the required set. a real-world application is to identify face or an object in a picture. for the student intervention problem, this classifier could provide the benfit of correcting itself based on prior accuracy of predictions so that the error rates of predicting which student requires intervention could be itertively reduced.\n"
